## TASK 3 : EVOLUTION OF COMPUTER NETWORKING:

Originally, computers were treated as larger complex machines and were operated by specially trained people. After WAN was discovered in 1965 by Thomas Marill and Lawrence Roberts who were the researchers at MIT, the interest started rapidly evolving. 

Over the course of time, the high-performance computing (HPC) systems became very powerful, agile and less costly. Cloud Computing played an important role here. Cloud Computing is the on demand delivery of compute power and is the future of networking. Cloud Computing has accelerated the evolution of high performance computing by allowing the self-service provisioning of IT services in minutes.
