## **Lesson 1: An Introduction To Cloud Computing and AWS:**

Cloud Computing is refers to the system which is capable of delivering on demand services, more specifically computing power, data storage, applications, and many other resources without the actual and direct infrastructure needed on the local machine. 

In simpler words, On principle the system of cloud computing is very similar to distribution of electricity as a service. The only difference being, the cloud delivery system is used to deliver the cloud-services and the underlying infrastructure in not required on the local machine. 

Today, Cloud power majority of IT sectors, right from businesses to finance, real estate to retail. 

In general, a user has access to data, applications and storage that needs not be stored on the user’s computer. **Cloud delivers computing, storage and applications as a service, and not a product.** Cloud accomplishes increasing computing capabilities without needing a new infrastructure. Cloud Computing also eliminates the need to make large upfront investments in hardware and management of hardware. A number of resources can be obtained (as many as needed) in real time based on **pay as you go** mode of payment. The **pay as you** go enables users to only pay for the services they are using instead of pre paying for estimated resource usage. 

**History of AWS:**

AWS traces its roots to 2006,  when it began to provide services to businesses. This was later adopted to the term which are familiar with today i.e. **Cloud Computing.**

**Why Use Cloud?**

Cloud facilitates a number of benefits. 



*   **Allows Scalability of applications:** An application using cloud can be scaled up and down as and when needed. For example, During the sale season, Amazon (or any other online shopping site) scales up the number of servers running for managing the large number of users walking through the website. During the off-season the company scales the servers down. This scalability can be achieved very easily with Cloud. 
*   **Pay as you Go:** Cloud allows a user to pay for the services upon its usage. The user need not pay well in advance based on some estimate.
*   **Dynamic Capacity:** Cloud entirely eliminates the guessing of infrastructure or capacity needed because it avails services at the real time, which can be scaled.
*   **Increased Speed and Performance:** Cloud enables much increased speed and performance because it utilizes the resources of the cloud itself rather than the local machine.
*   **Go global in minutes :** Applications can be deployed on cloud in just a few clicks. (in multiple regions around the world)

**Types of cloud computing:**

Cloud Computing provides developers and IT departments with the ability to focus on the most important parts, leaving the rest (undifferentiated work) for Cloud. These jobs include procurement, maintenance, capacity planning, etc. 

Several different models and deployment strategies have emerged to help meet specific needs of different users. Each type of cloud service, and deployment method, provides you with different levels of control, flexibility, and management. 

These types are: 



1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
3. Software as a Service (SaaS)

Understanding the difference between the three helps a user to identify which type fits the needs. 

**Infrastructure as a Service:**

IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It provides access to networking, computers (hardware or a VM), and data storage space. It has the highest level of flexibility and management control. 

**Platform as a Service:**

PaaS eliminates the need to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows to focus on the deployment and management of applications.

**Software as a Service:**

Software as a Service provides a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. 

To summarise the all three types, here is an example,

Harsh has just started learning Cloud Computing. He wants to understand the difference IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. He decides to practically understand it. He goes to a cloud service. He is given three options, 

**Option 1**: ‘Do you want to use cloud by stating your infrastructural needs, like 4 GB of RAM, a number of cores, some disk space. You will also need to handle the platform inside the infrastructure yourself (like the operating system or VM)’. 

**This is Infrastructure as a Service.(IaaS)**

**Option 2**: ‘We have already built an infrastructure for you, you have the platforms ready too, all you need to worry about is deploying/developing your application onto it”. 

**This is Platform as a Service(PaaS)**

**Option 3:** ‘We have the full-fledged application ready on cloud, you can use it as a service’. **This is Software as a Service. (SaaS).**

**Deployment Models in Cloud Computing:**



1. **Cloud (Public)**

    A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in the cloud. Applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been migrated from an existing infrastructure to take advantage of the benefits of cloud Computing.

2. **Hybrid**

    A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. 

3. **On-Premises (Private)**

    The deployment of resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is sometimes called the “private cloud.” On-premises deployment doesn’t provide many of the benefits of cloud computing but is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources. In most cases this deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure while using application management and virtualization technologies to try and increase resource utilization.
