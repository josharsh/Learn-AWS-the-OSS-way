## **Lesson 2: AWS Overview:**

AWS is a **cloud service platform**. A cloud Service platform in general owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services which is provisioned by a user typically via a web application. 

Today known companies and brands line reddit, pinterest and Netflix use AWS for their business and other needs. When reddit wanted to scale up, it had only 20 employees working and the company then ran on physical servers. The company realized that it had problems managing everything with just 20 employees, and decided to switch to AWS. AWS enabled the smooth working of the  company and allowed them to scale up with just 20 employees. 

**WHY USE AWS?**



*   **Better Capacity Planning:**

    Using the traditional capacity planning always involves keeping extra unused capacity based on the pageviews, or traffic. In traditional capacity planning, at times the needs go higher than the allotted capacity which results in poor user experience due to increased traffic and underwhelming capacity to hold and manage the traffic. But AWS enables dynamic capacity planning which does not require any extra wastage of capacity and allows scaling up and down of capacity as and when needed. Suppose there is a large demand, so you can simply scale your capacity up and bring it down when the traffic is down.
