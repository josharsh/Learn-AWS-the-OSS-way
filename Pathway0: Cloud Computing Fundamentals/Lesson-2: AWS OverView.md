## **Lesson 2: AWS Overview:**

AWS is a **cloud service platform**. A cloud Service platform in general owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services which is provisioned by a user typically via a web application. 

Today known companies and brands line reddit, pinterest and Netflix use AWS for their business and other needs. When reddit wanted to scale up, it had only 20 employees working and the company then ran on physical servers. The company realized that it had problems managing everything with just 20 employees, and decided to switch to AWS. AWS enabled the smooth working of the  company and allowed them to scale up with just 20 employees. 

**WHY USE AWS?**



*   **Better Capacity Planning:**

    Using the traditional capacity planning always involves keeping extra unused capacity based on the pageviews, or traffic. In traditional capacity planning, at times the needs go higher than the allotted capacity which results in poor user experience due to increased traffic and underwhelming capacity to hold and manage the traffic. But AWS enables dynamic capacity planning which does not require any extra wastage of capacity and allows scaling up and down of capacity as and when needed. Suppose there is a large demand, so you can simply scale your capacity up and bring it down when the traffic is down.

# Services by AWS:

AWS provides many services. Some of the services are: 

**1: AWS Analytics Services:**

AWS provides Powerful services to process, analyze, visualize data easily and cost-effectively.

Some of the analytics Services are: 



*   Amazon ElasticSearch
*   Amazon Elastic MapReduce
*   Amazon Kinesis
*   Amazon Redshift
*   Amazon Athena

**2: AWS Compute Services:**

Virtual Server Hosting, Container Management, and Serverless Computing. AWS has over 70 infrastructure services. AWS offers multiple compute products allowing you to deploy, run, and scale your applications as virtual servers, containers, or code.

Some of the compute Services are:



*   Amazon EC2:

    Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) makes it  easy to obtain virtual servers.

*   Amazon Lightsail:

    Lightsail is designed to be the easiest way to launch and manage a virtual private server with AWS. Lightsail plans include everything you need to jumpstart your project – a virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP – for a low, predictable price

*   Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)

    Amazon EC2 Container Registry (Amazon ECR) help you to deploy, manage, and scale Docker-enabled applications on AWS. This includes building docker images and pushing them to a private secure repository, creating a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances, the Amazon ECS agent, writing a task definition, running tasks, task placement strategies, and running services.

*   Amazon Lambda

    You can use AWS Lambda to run your code in response to events, such as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table; to run your code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway; or invoke your code using API calls made using AWS SDKs.


**3: AWS Database Services **

Purpose-built databases for all your application needs Managed Relational, Non-Relational, Data Warehouse, In-Memory Data Store, and Graph Databases.



*   Amazon DynamoDB
*   Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
*   Amazon Redshift
*   Amazon Aurora

**4: AWS Developer Tools:**

The AWS Developer Tools is a set of services designed to enable developers and IT operations professionals practicing DevOps to rapidly and safely deliver software.



*   Amazon CodeCommit
*   Amazon CodePipeline
*   Amazon CodeBuild
*   Amazon CodeDeploy

**5: AWS Management Tools**

AWS provides a set of management tools that allows you to programmatically provision, monitor, and automate all the components of your cloud environment.



*   Amazon CloudFormation
*   Amazon CloudWatch
*   Amazon Systems Manager
*   Amazon CloudTrail

**6: AWS Networking and Content Delivery Services**

*   Amazon Direct Connect
*   Amazon Route 53
*   Amazon Elastic Load Balancing
*   Amazon CloudFront

**7: AWS Storage Services**

Cloud storage is a critical component of cloud computing, holding the information used by applications. Big data analytics, data warehouses, Internet of Things, databases, and backup and archive applications all rely on some form of data storage architecture. Cloud storage is typically more reliable, scalable, and secure than traditional on-premises storage systems.



*   Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
*   Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
*   Amazon S3
*   Amazon Glacier
